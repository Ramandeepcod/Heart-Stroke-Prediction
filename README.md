# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using Machine Learning algorithms. 
The goal is to build a reliable predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis and healthcare decision-making.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Model training using multiple ML algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Model deployment using Streamlit

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📈 Model Performance
The best performing model achieved:
- Accuracy: 0.82
- Precision: 0.85
- Recall: 0.83
- F1-Score: 0.84

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Dataset is loaded and cleaned.
2. Missing values are handled.
3. Data is scaled using StandardScaler.
4. Models are trained and evaluated.
5. The best model is saved using `joblib`.
6. (Optional) Deployed using Streamlit for user interaction.
